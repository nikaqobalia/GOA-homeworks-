<h2>my hobby is playing football</h2>

<h2>Football</h2>
<p>The game, as a rule, was formed in England, and the association followed the creation of football, the laws of which were drawn up in 1863 to determine the development of the sport.
     The international governing organization of football is FIFA (French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association; acronym - FIFA). 
     The biggest soccer competition is the World Cup, which is the most watched sports event in the world.</p>

<h2>FIFA world football championship</h2>

<h3>Prehistory and the first championship</h3>
<p>The first international match in the history of football was the meeting in Glasgow in 1872 between the national teams of Scotland and England (ended with the score 0–0),
     and the first international tournament in 1884, which was called the Great British Home Championship.
     The popularity of football increased especially at the end of the 19th century, and this sport was included in the Olympic Games in the 1900 and 1904 seasons, although the winners were not awarded medals.</p>
     
<p>In 1906, the newly founded FIFA held the first international tournament between the countries' teams in Switzerland, but the official FIFA history tournament "failed".</p>
    
<p>In 1908, he participated in the next Olympic Games in London, where football was already an official type of Olympics. Gold medals were won by the English team.
     Only participants took part in the competition, therefore it was more of a show than a tournament.</p>

<p>In 1909, in Turin, the Scottish baronet Sir Thomas Lipton held a cup draw of his own name, where not national teams, but individual clubs participated, although each of them represented a specific country.
     This tournament is sometimes referred to as the first World Cup.Prestigious professional clubs from Italy, Germany, Switzerland took part in the tournament, but the English Football Association refused to send clubs.
     Instead, Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur team from County Durham. The West Oakland team managed to win the tournament, and two years later successfully defended the title.</p>
