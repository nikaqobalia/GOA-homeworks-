            <p>Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity.
                 Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called "football" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, 
                 such as Australia,[8] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[9] and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, 
                "football" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.[10]</p>
